# CIS17B-S25-33477-Assignment6
This assignment is a demonstration of GUIs using maps. I had a lot of difficulty on this one due to needing to study a lot of documentation, but the project runs. Unfortunately, I could not merge the maps with the GUI layout, so the list will not update. It will add items and recognize duplicate ones, but i'm highly unsure about the find and remove items. As for the main code, a lot of it seems quite unsightly to look at, but it essentially connects the lines to the buttons, and those button functions do the work. As to why the connectors are like that, I saw it as the only way to pass an object's data and get information to it. Overall, there's so much to this that it felt extremely overwhelming to do. Any feedback on properly displaying and connecting the backend to the frontend is greatly welcomed.
